- Big change is using Duration and LocalDate in the Track class.
  - Change to Entity property types.
  - We have decided to store the durations as Varchars and
    use the default Duration String syntax
  - Have to create a JPADurationConverter to convert from Duration to String.

- Using the Criteria API in JPAStudentDAO to build dynamic Querys.
  - Also check out the use of the JPA Metamodel to build the queries.
  - Metamodel is created by the Hibernate Jpa Metamodel generator.  Configured
    in pom.xml.  Metamodel output files are in target/generated-sources.
